#Come usare questa Repo

1 Scaricare lo Zip oppure Clonare la Repo.
2 Entrare all'interno del progetto dal terminale cd/nome-progetto
3 lanciare il comando npm install
4 entrare nella lezione da seguire dove troverete 2 cartelle: inizio e risultato.\
Inizio contiene un file .js con già gli import basilari necessari
Riusltato il risultato della lezione che stai seguendo
(troverai anche un file .css già precompilato)
5 lanciare npm run start

##Perchè questa impostazione

Questo è un corso di React, non di css, nè di bootstrap tantomeno di HTML o javascript
Seguire l'impostazione di Cartelle, CSS, styling generale porterebbe via troppo tempo\
che non potremmo più dedicare all'apprendimento di React.js.

Cercherò di spiegare il più possibile funzioni e metodi in Vanilla Javascript (javascript puro).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
